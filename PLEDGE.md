# The Fair Innovation Pledge

> I believe technology should serve **everyone fairly**.  
>  
> My work will always keep a **path free and open** for all to use, learn from, and build upon.  
>  
> I may monetize advanced tools or new creations â€”  
> **but never at the cost of accessibility or fairness.**
